# Welcome to HestJS

**HestJS** is a modern, type-safe Node.js framework inspired by NestJS, built with **Hono** and **TSyringe** for dependency injection.

## What is HestJS?

HestJS combines the best of modern web development:

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Built on top of Hono for blazing-fast performance
- 💉 **Dependency Injection**: Uses TSyringe for clean, testable code
- 🎯 **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict typing
- 🏗️ **OOP Design**: Object-Oriented Programming patterns like NestJS
- 📦 **Modular**: Clean, modular architecture for scalable applications

## Getting Started

Get started with HestJS in less than 5 minutes.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (recommended) or npm/yarn

## Create a new HestJS project

Generate a new HestJS project using our CLI tool:

```bash
npx create-hest-app my-app
```

Or with Bun:

```bash
bunx create-hest-app my-app
```

The command will create a new HestJS application with all the necessary dependencies and a basic project structure.

## Start your application

Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-app
bun run dev
```

Your HestJS application will be running at http://localhost:3000/.
